# Data Structures Collection

Welcome to this repository! Here you will find implementations of various **data structures**, including their code and explanations.

## What's Included

This repository contains implementations of commonly used data structures such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables (Hash Maps)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs
- Tries
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
- Segment Trees
